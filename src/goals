1. Client side change:
- ability for the client to run the same task (parallel) on multiple nodes in the same time
   definition: use -n with multiple wallet addresses separated by comma (maximum 10 addresses)
   definition: for more than 10 address pick it up from file (delimited by row)
   definition: -n address or file
   definition: check wallet address validity
- show all the results for all tasks
- total execution time for each node
- define failed execution: 10 minutes



2. Client side change + node side change(?)
- Current flow
client transaction to request execution
node transaction to execute
client transaction to approve execution
node executes
node publishes the result
client shows result on screen

- Expected flow:
client transaction to request execution
node transaction to execute
node executes
node transaction to publish result
client shows result
